Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm Ruthran Chandrasekar, a healthcare data scientist. 

I have a Masters in Engineering from [Duke University](https://cee.duke.edu/grad/masters/meng-computational-mechanics) 
where I studied Computational Mechanics and healthcare data science.

Prior to that I obtained my B.Tech. in Materials Engineering from the 
[Indian Institute of Technology Madras.](https://www.iitm.ac.in/academics/departments/department-of-metallurgical-and-materials-engineering)

In my spare time, you can find me curled up in a corner reading books, scrolling through my curated Reddit communities
or tinkering with my [YNAB](https://www.ynab.com) personal budget.
