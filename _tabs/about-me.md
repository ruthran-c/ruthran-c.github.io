Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm Ruthran Chandrasekar, a healthcare data scientist. 

I have a Masters in Engineering from [Duke University](https://cee.duke.edu/grad/masters/meng-computational-mechanics) 
where I studied Computational Mechanics and healthcare data science.

Prior to that I obtained my B.Tech. in Materials Engineering from the 
[Indian Institute of Technology Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/academics/departments/department-of-metallurgical-and-materials-engineering)

In my spare time, you can find me curled up in a corner reading books, scrolling through my curated Reddit communities
or tinkering with my [YNAB](https://www.ynab.com) personal budget.

## Work Experience

In my 2 years in the United States workforce, I have worked for 3 organizations:
1. Duke University - Data Science Intern
2. Hospital Iq Inc. - Associate Data Scientist
3. LeanTaaS Inc. - Data Scientist

You can find more information about the work I did in these organisations through the ðŸ‘† designation links.
