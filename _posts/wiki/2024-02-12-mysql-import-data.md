Importing data from a `.csv` file into a MySQL database using Workbench's data import wizard is 
notoriously slow. My recent import of a `(500000, 6)` shaped table into MySQL using the wizard took over an hour's
time.[^workbench]

## Objective
To load data from a local `.csv` file into MySQL through `LOAD DATA INFILE`.

## Prerequisites
1. MySQL installed - I did it through `homebrew`.
2. MySQL Workbench (Optional) - Visual tool for databases.

## Steps
### Create table to import data
Firstly, we need a table in MySQL for the data to be imported into. If the table already exists, all fine.
Else, we need to create a new table in MySQL either through the command line or through MySQL Workbench.

To do this,
1. In MySQL Workbench, right-click on the database (schema) into which you want the table added.
2. Click on `Table Data Import Wizard`
3. The wizard will take you through the steps to import data.
4. In the final page of the wizard, you'll be able to see the log for the import. Once the log is active,
and you see multiple lines of `- Data import`, we're good to go.
5. Cancel the process and refresh the schemas using the ðŸ”„ button. You should see the new table appear.
6. Right-click on the table and hit `Truncate Table`.

We now have a proper empty table for data imports!
