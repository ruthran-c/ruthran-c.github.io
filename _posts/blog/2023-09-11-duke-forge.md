[Duke AI Health](https://aihealth.duke.edu) (previously Duke Forge) 
is Duke's center for actionable health data science.

## Background
Duke Forge holds a yearly summer data science internship that has now been expanded into a 2-year fellowship program.

I was a part of 7 others selected for this program to do epidemiological research using AI on the emergence, diagnosis
and treatment of diseases.

I worked on a text-based NLP project on **Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD)**[^mayo-pad].
