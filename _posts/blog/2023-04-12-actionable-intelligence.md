# The power of actionable intelligence through AI:
---
I've noticed that actionable intelligence can go a long way in improving our complicated healthcare system. 

Specifically in perioperative care:
- Predicting the block utilization of doctors (or service lines) can help allocate more OR resources to those in demand
    - This results in lesser wait times for elective surgeries
- Better staffing optimization tells us exactly how many nurses we need vs. how many we have scheduled.
    - This helps managers plan the day and alleviate any overworking situations.
- Predicting the length of surgery duration would help in optimally scheduling for OR time and maximising OR utilization
    - No running around trying to find an alternate OR because of a surgery exceeding its schedule and delaying the rest of the day.
- Finally, a central platform containing all the processes in the perioperative cycle provides universal access to all stakeholders.
    - This means all staff related to the surgery are on the same platform and no information is lost in between.

If the centralized platform helps the caregivers in planning the entire surgery, then nothing is forgotten and unplanned costs to the event are minimized. 

All of this means more money for hospitals and more standardized care for patients.
1. ORs are considered the top in both revenue source and expenditures for a hospital accounting for over 50% of revenues and over 25% of expenses.
2. For the patient, it would reduce the risks by shortening the length of time under anaesthesia and limiting infections that can occur due to door openings during the event.
