The more common probability question is to calculate the probability of atleast
2 people in a group sharing the same birthday.

This is simple since we just need to calculate the probability of the group never
sharing a birthday and then invert it.

Now how about exactly 2 people sharing the same birthday and the rest having separate ones?
